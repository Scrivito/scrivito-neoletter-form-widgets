## Installation

**Note:** If you have existing forms, they will run in legacy mode after installing this package. Legacy mode allows you to continue using your existing forms, but the new form features such as `review` or `steps` cannot be used by them. You can still add new widgets to existing forms.


Install the package into your scrivito app:

```shell
npm install scrivito-neoletter-form-widgets
```

Import the `initNeoletterFormWidgets` function from the package, and call it in your index.js file found in the Widgets folder (e.g. in `src/Widgets/index.js`), passing your Scrivito tenant ID to the function:
```js
import { initNeoletterFormWidgets } from 'scrivito-neoletter-form-widgets';

initNeoletterFormWidgets(process.env.SCRIVITO_TENANT);
```



Add the widget styles to your app. 
This can be done by either loading the CSS via `css-loader` (e.g. in `src/index.js` or `src/Widgets/index.js`):

```js
import 'scrivito-neoletter-form-widgets/index.css';
```

 Or by importing the styles into your stylesheets (e.g. in `src/assets/stylesheets/index.scss`):

```scss
@import '~scrivito-neoletter-form-widgets/index.css';
```

Delete all form widgets included in the Example App from the "Widgets" folder:
- FormButtonWidget
- FormCheckboxWidget
- FormContainerWidget
- FormHiddenFieldWidget
- FormInputFieldWidget

You're done! Enjoy building well-designed and cleverly arranged forms!

### Review Dialog

<img src="images/review_dialog.png" width="350" alt="Screenshot">

### Closing the Dialog

Users can close the review dialog in three ways:

1. **Click Outside:** Clicking anywhere outside the dialog will close it.
2. **ESC Key:** Users can press the "ESC" key on their keyboard to close the dialog.
3. **Close Button:** The dialog also includes a close button in the footer for users who prefer to close it manually.

It's important to note that the footer with the close button is not mandatory. Users can easily close the dialog using any of the methods mentioned above.

### Inclusion of Elements

By default, the Review feature checks and includes elements of types "input," "select," and "textarea" when displaying responses in the review. This means that only responses from these elements are shown in the review dialog, allowing users to verify their information.

Custom widgets with hidden inputs can also have their values displayed in the review when the "show-in-review" class is added to the hidden input.

The Review feature is specifically designed for forms with multiple steps, providing users with an opportunity to verify their responses before final submission.


# Custom Form Widgets

In addition to the built-in form widgets, you have the flexibility to use custom widgets, allowing you to enhance your forms with unique features and interactions. Custom form widgets can be used for various purposes, such as sliders, tri-state checkboxes, or any specialized input elements that you create as custom widgets and incorporate into your forms.

## Custom Form Widget Validation

When working with custom form widgets, it's important to ensure proper validation to maintain the integrity of your forms. The Scrivito Form Widgets package provides several useful functions for this purpose:

#### `insideFormContainerValidation`

- This function checks if the given widget is placed inside a form. It's crucial to confirm that your custom form widgets are correctly structured within a form container to maintain the expected behavior.

#### `getFormContainer`

- Use this function to find the first form container within your widget hierarchy. It returns the container widget, or `null` if no container is found.

#### `customFieldNameValidation`

- This function checks if the custom field attribute, which must be named "customFieldName," is unique within the widget hierarchy. To meet the requirements for custom field names, they must start with "custom_" and be unique.

For custom widgets that use hidden inputs and want to show the hidden input values in the review, you should add the class "show-in-review" to the hidden input element. This class indicates that the hidden input's value should be displayed in the review.

**Note:** The review feature displays both the question and the answer for each input. To ensure that the question is displayed in the review, you should provide a "label" or "title" attribute within your custom widgets.

By following these guidelines and specifying these validation functions in your custom form widget edit configuration, you can create and integrate custom form widgets seamlessly into your forms, ensuring that they function as intended.

Custom form widgets offer endless possibilities for tailoring your forms to your specific needs, enhancing the user experience and interaction.

## Custom Form Widgets Example

To gain a better understanding of how custom form widgets can be used, let's explore an example. In this case, we'll create a custom slider widget that includes a hidden input, a label, and the "show-in-review" class to display the label and value in the review.

### Creating a Custom Slider Widget

1. Start by creating a new folder named "FormSliderWidget" inside the "Widgets" folder of your Scrivito App.

2. Inside the "FormSliderWidget" folder, create three files:

#### FormSliderWidgetClass.js

```js
import * as Scrivito from "scrivito";

export const FormSliderWidget = Scrivito.provideWidgetClass(
  "FormSliderWidget",
  {
    attributes: {
      label: "string",
      customFieldName: "string",
    },
  }
);

```

#### FormSliderWidgetComponent.js

```js
import * as React from "react";
import * as Scrivito from "scrivito";

Scrivito.provideComponent("FormSliderWidget", ({ widget }) => {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState(50);
  return (
    <div className="row mb-3">
      <span className="text-super">{widget.get("label")}</span>
      <input
        type="range"
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.currentTarget.value)}
        min="0"
        max="100"
        value={value}
      />
      <input
        type="hidden"
        className="show-in-review"
        name={widget.get("customFieldName")}
        value={value}
      ></input>
    </div>
  );
});

```

#### FormSliderWidgetEditingConfig.js

```js
import * as Scrivito from "scrivito";
import {
  customFieldNameValidation,
  insideFormContainerValidation,
} from "scrivito-neoletter-form-widgets";

Scrivito.provideEditingConfig("FormSliderWidget", {
  title: "Form Slider",
  attributes: {
    label: { title: "Label" },
    customFieldName: { title: "Field name" },
  },
  properties: ["label", "customFieldName"],
  initialContent: {
    label: "Slide me",
    customFieldName: "custom_",
  },
  validations: [insideFormContainerValidation, customFieldNameValidation],
});

```

Please note that this example is intended to provide a basic demonstration of creating a custom form widget. It does not include styles or detailed CSS. You can further enhance the appearance and functionality of your custom widgets to match your specific design and usability requirements.
